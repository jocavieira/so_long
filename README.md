# 🏁 so_long – 42 School Project

*"Turn your maps into adventures!"* 🎮

**so_long** is a small 2D game project where you build a **top-down collectible game in C** using the **MiniLibX library**.  
Players navigate a map, collect items, and reach the exit — the game ends when all collectibles are gathered and the exit is reached.
